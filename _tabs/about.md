Hello and welcome to my portfolio page that showcase the projects, past course content, coding challenages that I do every day. 

# Personal Summary

I am a programmer doing computer science at ANU, with Machine Learning background, but appreciate data science and web development. I am about to graduate with an excellent honours grade close to first-class and a good academic result ranking in the top 7%-15% for the degree.

`N.B.` I will have a working visa 485 from June 2023 and I will be able to obtain PR from ACT stream within a year. I don't need a visa sponsor.

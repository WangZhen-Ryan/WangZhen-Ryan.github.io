### N.B. The game.jar is not upload.

## The board game called [Agamemnon](https://ospreypublishing.com/agamemnon) designed by Günter Cornett. This version is an implementation by us using Java and JavaFx for UI.

### Game Rules 

Agamemnon is a two-player game in which the players compete to win the Trojan War by controlling the *Strings of Fate* that span across the board.
For a complete description, and in case of any ambiguities in the assignment description,
consult the game rules which are distributed with the published game.

#### Strings of Fate

Spaces (nodes) on the board are connected by edges of three different types: *Strength* (red), *Leadership* (white), and *Force* (yellow).
A *String of Fate* is a connected set of edges of the same type.

![Strength edge](https://github.com/WangZhen-Ryan/Agamemnon/blob/main/assets/strength.png?raw=true)

Strength strings are won by the player with the highest combined strength in tiles on connected nodes.

![Leadership edge](https://github.com/WangZhen-Ryan/Agamemnon/blob/main/assets/leadership.png?raw=true)

Leadership strings are won by the player with the highest-ranked Leader tile on any connected node.

![Force edge](https://github.com/WangZhen-Ryan/Agamemnon/blob/main/assets/force.png?raw=true)

Force strings are won by the player with the most tiles on connected nodes.

For example, in the image below, a Force string connects nodes 20, 25, 23, and 24;
a Leadership string connects nodes 20, 18, and 23;
and a Strength string connects nodes 19 and 24.
(Other nodes are also connected, but they can't be seen in this image as it only shows part of the board.)

#### Tiles

There are four types of tiles.

*Warrior* tiles have a strength of one, two, or three; 
each player has three Warrior tiles of strength one ('f'), 
two Warrior tiles of strength two ('g'),
and one Warrior tile of strength three ('h').

Each player has five *Leader* tiles ('a'-'e'), which have both a strength and a rank.
The highest-ranked Leader tile is 'a' and the lowest is 'e'.
When Warrior and Leader tiles are placed, they simply remain in place until the end of the game.

Finally, each player has two *Weft* tiles ('i') and two *Warp* tiles ('j').
Wefts and Warps do not have a strength or leadership rank, but they do count towards force.
When a *Weft* tile is placed, it breaks any Strings of Fate that would have connected through that node,
i.e. the edges on either side of the node are now considered to belong to separate Strings of Fate,
and the Weft is connected to each of the Strings separately.
When a *Warp* tile is placed, the player who placed it chooses two of the neighbouring edges and switches them,
thereby altering the Strings of Fate.

If a player draws a Weft or a Warp tile during their first two turns, 
they may replace it, shuffle their tiles, and choose another tile.

#### Game Play

Players take turns to select tiles and place them on empty spaces on the board.
The players' tiles are placed face down (so they can't be seen) and tiles are randomly selected.
On the first turn, the first player selects a tile and places it on a chosen space on the board.
On subsequent turns, each player randomly selects two tiles and then places them in either order on empty spaces on the board.
On the final turn, the second player places a single tile in one of the remaining empty spaces 
(there will always be two empty spaces remaining on the board at the end of the regular game,
or three empty spaces in the [Loom Variant](#The Loom)).

The game ends when the final tile has been placed, and the score is calculated.
Each String of Fate that is won by a player counts towards that player's score according to the number of edges it contains.
In case of a tie for a String of Fate (for example, both players have the same combined strength on a strength String), neither player receives points for that String.
In the case of a tie for the highest-ranked Leader on a leadership string, the next highest-ranked Leader tiles for each player are compared and so on until a winner is found or there are no more Leader tiles to compare.
The player with the highest score (that is, the highest number of edges controlled) wins the game;
in case of equal scores, the game is declared a tie.

### Encoding Game State

#### Board Edges

The game is played on a board comprised of 32 nodes (33 in the Loom variant), connected by 49 edges (66 for the Loom).
The nodes are numbered starting from zero and in the provided interface are always referred to by number.

*Edges* are specified by their edge type:
 - S = Strength
 - L = Leadership
 - F = Force
 - E = empty (Loom variant only)
 
and by their endpoints in ascending order of node number.
For example, the edge "S0510" is a Strength edge connecting nodes 5 and 10.

The initial connectivity of the standard Agamemnon board is "S0001S0004F0105L0204F0206L0203L0306S0307L0408S0409S0510F0508F0611S0712F0813S0809S0911S1015F1114L1112S1216F1217S1315F1314L1418L1419F1520L1619S1617F1722L1820L1823S1924F1921F2025L2126F2122L2226F2325F2324F2427S2428L2529L2628L2729L2728S2831S2930S3031".

#### Tile Placements

Each player has fifteen pieces, of ten different types.

 - 'a' = Leader, rank = A and strength = 1
 - 'b' = Leader, rank = B and strength = 3
 - 'c' = Leader, rank = C and strength = 4
 - 'd' = Leader, rank = D and strength = 3
 - 'e' = Leader, rank = E and strength = 2
 - 'f' = Warrior of strength 1 (three per player)
 - 'g' = Warrior of strength 2 (two per player)
 - 'h' = Warrior of strength 3
 - 'i' = Weft weaver (two per player)
 - 'j' = Warp weaver (two per player)

A *tile placement* string is four characters in length, 
and is encoded by a single character indicating the player ('O' for the first player, 'B' for the second),
followed by a single character for the tile type, 
followed by two characters for the node.
For example, "Ob10" denotes placement of the first player's 'b' Leader tile on node 10,
whereas "Bg06" denotes placement of one of the second player's Warrior (strength 2) tiles on node 6.

#### Actions

A player's action for each turn is encoded as an *action string*, which is composed of two *sub-actions*.
An *sub-action* is the same as a tile placement for all tile types except Warp tiles.

For a Warp tile, a sub-action is eight characters in length and is encoded by the player identifier, 
followed by the Warp tile type ('J'), 
followed by two characters indicating the node on which the Warp is placed, 
followed by four characters indicating the nodes defining the edges that are to be switched by the Warp tile.
For example, "Oj151020" denotes the first player's placement of a Warp tile at node 15, 
so that the edges connecting to nodes 10 and 20 are switched.

#### Current State

The current game state at any turn is encoded as an array of two strings.
The first string is a concatenation of *tile placements*, and the second is a concatenation of *edges*.
For example, the example game below is encoded by the following state:
{"Of04Bc08Bf09Oc11Oj13Bh14", "S0001S0004F0105L0204F0206L0203L0306S0307L0408S0409S0510F0508F0611S0712F0813S0809S0911S1015F1114L1112S1216F1217F1315S1314L1418L1419F1520L1619S1617F1722L1820L1823S1924F1921F2025L2126F2122L2226F2325F2324F2427S2428L2529L2628L2729L2728S2831S2930S3031"}

Note that the second (edge) state string may change from one turn to the next based on the operation of Warp actions.
However, only the Warp tile placement is included in the first state string, 
so it may not be possible to determine the sequence of actions that led to the current state,
given the state strings alone.

### The Loom

In the Loom variant of the game, there are four different edge types: 'A','B','C','D'.
A custom board is created by choosing a mapping from 'S', 'L' and 'F' to 'A','B','C','D';
the remaining edge type is mapped to 'E' for "Empty".

The full connectivity of the Loom board is:
A0001B0002C0004D0104B0105B0203A0204A0206B0306B0307D0408C0409D0508A0510A0607A0609D0611C0712B0809B0810A0813C0911B0914C1013A1015D1112C1116C1216D1217D1314A1315C1318B1418D1419A1520A1617D1619A1621C1722A1819B1820A1823B1921D1924D2023B2025A2122A2124B2126D2227D2324A2325C2328B2426A2428C2529B2627D2630C2631C2731A2829C2830D2832D2932C3031D3032

and a sample mapping is:
L0001S0002E0004F0104S0105S0203L0204L0206S0306S0307F0408E0409F0508L0510L0607L0609F0611E0712S0809S0810L0813E0911S0914E1013L1015F1112E1116E1216F1217F1314L1315E1318S1418F1419L1520L1617F1619L1621E1722L1819S1820L1823S1921F1924F2023S2025L2122L2124S2126F2227F2324L2325E2328S2426S2428E2529S2627F2630E2631E2731L2829E2830F2832F2932E3031F3032

There are 24 such mappings (24 permutations of the four edge types).
In the Loom variant, a warp tile allows an edge of 'S', 'L', or 'F' type to be swapped with an empty edge.
